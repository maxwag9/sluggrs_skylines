# Emoji / Non-Vector Glyph Fallback Spec

## Problem

sluggrs_skylines cannot render bitmap-only glyphs (color emoji, bitmap fonts).
These glyphs have no vector outline - `extract_outline()` returns `None`.
Currently they are silently skipped, producing invisible text. This is
a user-visible bug that must be fixed before the iced integration ships.

## Background: How the current stack handles it

### cosmic_text

SwashCache rasterizes glyphs via swash with a priority chain:

```
Source::ColorOutline(0)   → COLR/CPAL tables (vector color glyphs)
Source::ColorBitmap(...)  → CBDT/SBIX tables (bitmap emoji)
Source::Outline           → glyf/CFF tables (regular vector outlines)
```

The result is a `SwashImage` with:
- `Content::Color` → RGBA pixels (4 bytes/pixel) - emoji, color glyphs
- `Content::Mask` → alpha pixels (1 byte/pixel) - regular text
- placement coordinates (top, left, width, height)

### cryoglyph

Handles both paths transparently:
- Two atlas textures: `color_atlas` (Rgba8) and `mask_atlas` (R8)
- etagere packer allocates space in the appropriate atlas
- Fragment shader uses `content_type` uniform to pick blend mode
- The caller (iced's text.rs) doesn't know or care which path a glyph takes

### sluggrs_skylines currently

- Tries `extract_outline()` → works for vector glyphs
- Returns `None` for bitmap-only glyphs → marks as `NON_VECTOR_GLYPH`
- Vertex packing skips non-vector entries → glyph disappears

## Options

### Option A: Implement bitmap atlas in sluggrs_skylines

Add a third texture (Rgba8) to TextAtlas for bitmap glyphs, with a
simple packer (etagere or manual). When `extract_outline()` returns
None, fall back to `SwashCache::get_image_uncached()` and pack the
bitmap into the atlas.

**Shader changes**: The fragment shader needs a branch - curve evaluation
for vector glyphs, texture sampling for bitmap glyphs. This could be
signaled via a flag in `glyph_data` (e.g. `band_offset == u32::MAX`
means "sample the bitmap atlas instead").

**Vertex format**: Bitmap glyphs need different per-instance data:
atlas UV coordinates instead of em_rect/band_transform/glyph_data.
Could reuse the same fields with different semantics when the flag
is set, or use a union-style layout.

**New dependencies**: etagere (or manual packer), a sampler in the
bind group.

**Pros**:
- Self-contained - sluggrs_skylines handles all text rendering
- Single crate dependency for iced
- Can optimize the bitmap path independently
- Full control over atlas management, growth, eviction

**Cons**:
- 500-800 lines of new code (packer, atlas texture, shader branch)
- Shader branching may impact performance (divergent warp)
- Duplicates work already done well in cryoglyph
- Bitmap cache is resolution-dependent (unlike our vector cache),
  adding complexity to cache key and eviction logic
- Need to handle the SwashCache parameter properly (currently ignored)

**Maintenance burden**: Medium. The bitmap atlas is conceptually simple
but has its own set of edge cases (atlas growth, eviction under
pressure, subpixel positioning for bitmap glyphs).

### Option B: Delegate bitmap glyphs to cryoglyph

Keep cryoglyph in iced's workspace (it's already there). During
`prepare()`, split glyphs into two lists: vector glyphs (sluggrs_skylines)
and bitmap glyphs (cryoglyph). In `render()`, issue two draw calls.

**Implementation**: sluggrs_skylines's TextRenderer holds an optional
cryoglyph::TextRenderer internally. When a non-vector glyph is
detected, it's routed to cryoglyph's prepare path. The render
call draws sluggrs_skylines glyphs first, then cryoglyph glyphs.

**No shader changes**: cryoglyph handles its own pipeline, shaders,
and atlas textures entirely.

**Pros**:
- Minimal new code (~100 lines of routing logic)
- Proven bitmap rendering (cryoglyph is battle-tested)
- No shader modifications
- Bitmap cache management already handled
- SwashCache is already wired through the API

**Cons**:
- cryoglyph becomes a real dependency (currently just in workspace)
- Two render pipelines active simultaneously
- Two sets of GPU resources (cryoglyph's atlas textures + sluggrs_skylines's
  curve/band textures)
- Version coupling - cryoglyph and sluggrs_skylines must agree on wgpu version
- The cryoglyph Cache, TextAtlas, and Viewport must be initialized
  and maintained alongside sluggrs_skylines's equivalents
- cryoglyph's TextArea/TextBounds types are identical to ours but
  technically separate types - need conversion or shared definition

**Maintenance burden**: Low code, but dependency coupling is a long-term
risk.

### Option C: Delegate at the iced level (text.rs)

Don't change sluggrs_skylines at all. Instead, modify iced's `text.rs` to
maintain both a sluggrs_skylines renderer and a cryoglyph renderer. Route
each glyph to the appropriate renderer based on whether it has a
vector outline.

**Pros**:
- sluggrs_skylines stays focused on vector rendering only
- Clean separation of concerns
- iced already manages the cryoglyph dependency
- No changes to sluggrs_skylines's API or shader

**Cons**:
- Requires modifying iced's text.rs more substantially
- Detection logic ("does this glyph have a vector outline?") must
  happen at the iced level, which doesn't have easy access to skrifa
- Each glyph needs to be classified before routing, adding overhead
  to the prepare path
- Two full text rendering pipelines in iced's render pass
- Makes the iced fork harder to rebase

## Recommendation

**Option C for now, Option A as a future goal.**

Rationale:

1. **Option C is the fastest to ship.** The iced fork already has
   cryoglyph in the workspace. We can keep cryoglyph active alongside
   sluggrs_skylines with minimal text.rs changes. Non-vector glyphs go through
   the existing proven path.

2. **The detection problem is solvable.** sluggrs_skylines can export a function
   like `has_vector_outline(font_data, face_index, glyph_id)` that
   iced's text.rs calls to decide the routing. This is a cheap check
   (just attempt outline extraction, no curve building).

3. **Option A is the right long-term answer** but it's a substantial
   investment that doesn't need to block the initial integration. Once
   sluggrs_skylines is stable in production, adding a bitmap atlas is a natural
   next step that eliminates the cryoglyph dependency entirely.

4. **Option B is the worst of both worlds.** It couples sluggrs_skylines to
   cryoglyph at the library level, which is harder to undo than
   coupling at the integration level (Option C).

## Option C Implementation Sketch

### sluggrs_skylines changes

Add a detection function:

```rust
/// Check whether a glyph has a vector outline that sluggrs_skylines can render.
/// Returns false for bitmap-only glyphs (emoji, bitmap fonts).
pub fn has_vector_outline(
    font_data: &[u8],
    face_index: u32,
    glyph_id: u16,
) -> bool {
    extract_outline(font_data, face_index, glyph_id, &[]).is_some()
}
```

Export it from lib.rs.

### iced text.rs changes

In the `prepare()` function, classify each TextArea's glyphs and
split into two batches:

```rust
// Rough sketch - actual implementation needs more thought
let mut sluggrs_skylines_areas = vec![];  // TextAreas with only vector glyphs
let mut cryoglyph_areas = vec![]; // TextAreas with only bitmap glyphs

// For mixed TextAreas, we'd need to render the same TextArea through
// both renderers, each skipping glyphs it can't handle.
```

**Problem**: This sketch is oversimplified. A single TextArea can
contain both vector and bitmap glyphs (e.g. "Hello 👋 world"). We
can't split at the TextArea level - we'd need glyph-level routing.

**Better approach**: Render every TextArea through both renderers.
sluggrs_skylines skips non-vector glyphs (it already does). cryoglyph renders
all glyphs. The visual result is correct: sluggrs_skylines draws vector text,
cryoglyph draws everything but its vector glyphs are drawn on top
of (or behind) sluggrs_skylines's.

**Even better**: Render every TextArea through both renderers, but
have cryoglyph skip vector glyphs. This avoids double-rendering.
This requires cryoglyph to know which glyphs to skip, which brings
us back to the detection problem.

**Simplest correct approach**: Render all text through sluggrs_skylines (which
skips non-vector glyphs) AND all text through cryoglyph (which renders
everything). Since cryoglyph renders behind sluggrs_skylines, the vector glyphs
from cryoglyph are hidden behind sluggrs_skylines's higher-quality vector
rendering. Emoji from cryoglyph shows through because sluggrs_skylines
doesn't draw anything there.

This works if:
- Both renderers use the same positions (they do - same TextArea)
- sluggrs_skylines draws on top of cryoglyph (draw order in render pass)
- Alpha blending doesn't cause artifacts for double-drawn vector
  glyphs (it shouldn't - sluggrs_skylines's output is opaque in the glyph
  interior, and both renderers produce the same shape)

**This might be the pragmatic answer**: zero routing logic, both
renderers see all text, sluggrs_skylines handles what it can, cryoglyph
catches what falls through. Double rendering of vector glyphs
wastes some GPU work but produces correct output.

## Open Questions

1. **Draw order and blending**: If cryoglyph draws first and sluggrs_skylines
   draws on top, does alpha blending produce correct results for
   overlapping vector glyphs? Both produce similar but not identical
   coverage - could cause visible fringing.

2. **Performance**: Rendering all text through both pipelines doubles
   the GPU work. For text-heavy applications (email client) this may
   be measurable. Profiling needed.

3. **COLR/CPAL vector emoji**: Some emoji fonts use COLR/CPAL tables
   which define emoji as layered vector outlines (not bitmaps). swash
   can rasterize these to RGBA bitmaps, but skrifa can also extract
   the outlines. Should sluggrs_skylines try to render these natively? This is
   complex (layered colored fills) but would avoid the bitmap path for
   modern emoji fonts.
