# sluggrs_skylines

GPU vector text rendering using the [Slug algorithm](https://terathon.com/blog/decade-slug.html). Evaluates quadratic bezier curves per-pixel in fragment shaders - resolution-independent, no texture atlas needed.

Drop-in replacement for [cryoglyph](https://github.com/iced-rs/cryoglyph) in the [iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced) GUI framework's wgpu text rendering pipeline.

Built with LLMs. See [LLM.md](LLM.md).

## How it works

Traditional text renderers (cryoglyph, glyphon) rasterize glyphs to bitmaps on the CPU, pack them into a GPU texture atlas, and draw textured quads. This works but has downsides: atlas memory pressure, re-rasterization on scale changes, and pixel-locked rendering.

sluggrs_skylines takes a different approach: glyph outlines (quadratic bezier curves) are uploaded to the GPU as control point data. The fragment shader evaluates these curves per-pixel to determine coverage, producing resolution-independent rendering with zero atlas overhead for vector glyphs.

Key advantages:
- **Resolution independent** - one cached outline serves all sizes
- **No atlas pressure** - vector data is ~100x smaller than bitmaps
- **Clean at any scale** - no rasterization artifacts at fractional DPI
- **Same API** - matches cryoglyph's interface for iced integration

## Status

Work in progress. The core rendering pipeline is functional and tested in production via [ratatoskr](https://github.com/folknor/ratatoskr):
- Outline extraction from any font (TrueType + CFF/OpenType) via [skrifa](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontations)
- Cubic-to-quadratic subdivision for CFF fonts
- Band acceleration structure for efficient per-pixel curve lookup
- WGSL fragment shader with full Slug curve evaluation
- Non-vector glyphs (color emoji, bitmap fonts) detected and classified - the [iced fork](https://github.com/folknor/iced/tree/sluggrs_skylines) routes these to cryoglyph's raster pipeline for two-pass rendering
- Pressure-based trim/eviction matching cryoglyph's frame-boundary semantics
- Retained prepared-text cache - skips glyph loop and GPU upload for unchanged text
- cryoglyph-compatible API (Cache, TextAtlas, TextRenderer, Viewport)
- Wired into iced's `text.rs` via [forked iced](https://github.com/folknor/iced/tree/sluggrs_skylines)
- Supports text borders

## Performance

Measured on an RTX 3080 at 1920x1080 with an email-client workload (5 text areas, ~8000 glyph instances, ~160 distinct glyphs, mixed 10-20px sizes, SansSerif + Monospace).

**Steady-state (static text):** prepare takes ~5µs per frame - the retained cache detects unchanged text and skips both the glyph loop and GPU upload entirely. GPU fragment shader render: ~100µs.

**Scrolling:** ~36µs per frame. Cached instances are position-adjusted and re-culled without rebuilding from font data.

**Cold start (new text):** ~2ms for 160 distinct glyphs (~13µs per glyph for outline extraction, band building, and GPU upload). Subsequent frames with the same text hit the retained cache.

**Memory:** ~4.8KB per distinct glyph in GPU storage buffer. Resolution-independent - the same cached glyph data serves all sizes without re-upload.
