# TODO

## iced fork (`repos/iced/`, branch `sluggrs_skylines` on `folknor/iced`)

Cleanup opportunities in `wgpu/src/text.rs` - cryoglyph heritage and dual-pipeline leftovers.

- [ ] **Arc\<RwLock\<TextAtlas\>\> friction** - write-locked during prepare, read-locked during render. RwLockReadGuard dies before RenderPass<'a>. Had to hoist lock to lib.rs + Pipeline::atlas() accessor. Cleaner with a callback pattern or pre-locked render context.
- [ ] **Lazy raster vertex buffer** - Storage creates per-TextRenderer vertex + raster buffers. Most groups never see a non-vector glyph. Allocate raster buffer on first use.
- [ ] **Dead SwashCache allocation** - atlas owns a persistent one now, but iced still creates one per frame for the `_cache` API param (ignored). Goes away with the API cleanup below.
- [ ] **Inline prepare() free function** - thin wrapper that just calls renderer.prepare(). Existed for the old raster.prepare() call. Inline at its two call sites (State::prepare, Storage::prepare).
- [ ] **Shared shift-or-invalidate** - vector and raster cache-hit paths both do integer-delta adjustments, duplicated. Vector adjusts screen_rect[0..1], raster adjusts physical.x/y. Unify.
- [ ] **Remove unused `_encoder` and `_cache` params** - thread through 4 functions, never used. Cryoglyph API compat.
- [ ] **Verify the buffer redraw lifecycle** - sluggrs_skylines' retained TextArea
  cache requires `buffer.redraw() == false` to hit, but iced's cached
  buffers (`graphics/src/text/cache.rs:45`) are never `set_redraw(false)`
  after shaping, so retained reuse may never engage in production iced.
  Verify and fix in the fork; the sluggrs_skylines-side occurrence-keyed cache
  (shipped) only pays off once this is enabled. **deep review**


## CPU - Cold path

Baseline: 92 glyphs, ~1.8ms cold prepare on RTX 3080.
Mixed-locale baseline: 364 glyphs, ~4.6ms cold prepare (`brokkr hotpath --target email2`).

### Additional cold-path items

- [x] ~~**Split prepare_with_depth into two passes**~~ done in `f28ac87`
  (three-pass split: classify areas → resolve misses → emit instances).
  Mono prep/commit seam (`prep::prepare_mono`, `text_atlas::commit_mono`)
  added in `e98d6d1`. Misses are now deduped before resolution.

## GPU - Shader

Baseline: 11µs headless / 71µs windowed (RTX 3080, 92 glyphs). Windowed
dominated by compositor/surface, not text math.

### Profiling infrastructure (do first)

- [ ] **RenderDoc inspection** - capture a frame via Vulkan backend
  (`WGPU_BACKEND=vulkan`), verify early-exit is triggering, check per-pixel
  loop iteration counts. The `renderdoc` crate provides programmatic
  capture.

### Optimization targets

- [ ] **Analytical AA / reduce 5x MSAA** - below 16ppem, shader runs
  `render_single` 5 times (full curve evaluation each). Biggest GPU cost
  at small text sizes. Evaluate curve intersection once and compute
  coverage analytically, or reduce to 2 samples. Up to 3-4x GPU at small
  ppem. Large effort.

- [ ] Texture fetch audit - verify no redundant loads in curve inner loop
- [ ] Branch divergence assessment - `abs(a.y) < 0.25` warp divergence
  between linear and quadratic paths. Confirm with Nsight/RGP if available.

### Correctness / reference sync

- [ ] **Diff against Slug reference** - check for upstream changes since
  translation. Key areas:
  - CalcRootCode: reference uses bitwise sign extraction (`asuint(y) >> 31`,
    single LOP3 on NVIDIA). Ours uses `select()`. Verify naga SPIR-V
    equivalence or switch to bitcast.
  - Dilation: reference uses dynamic vertex-shader dilation via inverse
    Jacobian. We use fixed 0.5px - compare quality and performance.

### Not worth pursuing

- Band split (dual-sort) - Lengyel removed it; hurts small text
- Supersampling - removed from reference; dilation handles it
- Compute shader rewrite - fundamentally different architecture, not
  compatible with render-pass integration
- Zero dilation for large text (48ppem+) - rejected: the AA support band
  outside the glyph boundary is half a pixel in *screen* space at every
  ppem (an outside sample at distance d < 0.5px carries 0.5 - d coverage),
  so killing dilation clips valid AA at tangential extrema regardless of
  size. Harfbuzz dilates unconditionally. **deep review**

## Architecture

- [ ] **iced wrapper does not expose scroll offset** - sluggrs_skylines exposes
  `Viewport::set_scroll_offset`, but the iced wrapper never calls it, so iced
  rendering always uses `[0,0]`. **wgpu, arch review**

## Future / Long-term

- [x] ~~**Parallel cold glyph processing (rayon)**~~ - tried, doesn't pay
  off. Per-glyph prep is ~13µs (extract_outline + build_bands + pack); rayon
  thread-pool init + coordination overhead exceeds the win even for the
  email2 workload (367 distinct misses): cold went 4.6ms → 11.5ms with
  `par_iter().map_init`. Mono prep+commit seam (`prep::prepare_mono`,
  `text_atlas::commit_mono`) was kept since it's parallel-ready, but the
  parallel iteration was reverted. Worth revisiting if individual glyphs
  get more expensive (analytical AA prep, larger bands).


### Harfbuzz divergences remaining

- [ ] **Jacobian-based vertex dilation** - full MVP-aware half-pixel
  expansion. Only needed for rotation/non-uniform scaling. Harfbuzz:
  `hb-gpu-vertex.wgsl:49-81`. **hb review**

## Polish

- [ ] naga_oil for shader dedup - `#import` to share code between
  simple_shader.wgsl and shader.wgsl. Eliminates copy-paste divergence.
- [ ] Texture growth stress test with CJK, mixed fonts

### Parked

- [ ] Color multiplication - `/ 255.0` → `* INV_255`. Cleanup, not priority.
